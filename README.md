# Exif Post #

This small project was created to check the image rotation, when taking a photo with the mobile phone. You can see it live [page](http://orangeeli.github.io/exif-post/). 

I've written a [post](https://medium.com/@Orangeeli/oh-my-exif-777335e26213#.whfs00wbx) about image rotation and about some of the problems developers will face when trying to handle the metadata set by the mobile when the photo is taken.

### Rotate JS ###
[Here](http://orangeeli.github.io/exif-post/rotateJS.html) you can try the upload form on a mobile phone and check the photo rotation with JS only.

### Rotate CSS ###
[Here](http://orangeeli.github.io/exif-post/rotateCSS.html) you can try the upload form on a mobile phone and check the photo rotation with CSS.
